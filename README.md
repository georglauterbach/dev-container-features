> #### What is a Development Container Feature?
>
> According to the [official documentation](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/), Development Container Features are "are self-contained, shareable units of installation code and development container configuration. The name comes from the idea that referencing one of them allows you to quickly and easily add more tooling, runtime, or library “features” into your development container for you or your collaborators to use."

Take a look at the [`src/` directory](./src/) to see which features exist.
